#sphere.io API description

sphere.io is a REST-API for e-commerce which serves as a a perfect demonstration 
on how to add external API to the elastic.io platform.

Before going into the description two words about [Swagger](http://swagger.wordnik.com/):

## Swagger

>Swagger is a specification and complete framework implementation for
>describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.

We at elastic.io chosen Swagger as our first REST service description language, other languages
(e.g. *WSDL* for SOAP Services or *WADL* or *Mashape* description languages will follow).

Swagger have following advantages over other alternatives:

* It's open source project distributed under Apache License, Version 2.0
* It has a modular structure (core, code generator, UI, etc)
* It has a significant traction and community acceptance
 
We believe that even if you don't use Swagger right now for documentaiton of your REST API you might benifit
from it in the long-term e.g. from Swagger Code Generation.
